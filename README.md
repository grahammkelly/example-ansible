# Test Playbook

A test project to create sample Ansible playbooks. Based off https://serversforhackers.com/an-ansible-tutorial

This project assumes a server running on 192.168.33.10. The sample Vagrant project accompanying this
project creates a (very) simple host on this address, based upon Ubuntu.
